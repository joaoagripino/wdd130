    <h2>Joao Maia</h2>
    <p>Hello, everyone! I'm Joao Maia, from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I'm married with Juliana for 25 years and we have three great young men. Living in Sao Paulo is great! In a city with 12 million inhabitants, we have people from every part of Brazil, and from many countries.</p>
    <p>I graduated in Architecture in 1996 and I have been working on AEC (Architecture, Engineering & Construction) since then. But I have a passion for technology and I always wanted to develop a parallel career in IT. That is why I am pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Technology, at BYU Idaho.</p>
    <p>I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Days Saints since 1993. It was my wife who first introduced me to the gospel of Jesus Christ, and I have developed a testimony and deep love for my Savior.</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting my web page.</p>
