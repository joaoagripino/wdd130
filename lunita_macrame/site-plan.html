      <h4>Welcome to Lunita!</h4>
      <p>
        Lunita Macramé is a company that produces and markets unique handcrafted pieces, inspired by nature. 
        Emerged from the challenging times of the pandemic, in a personal search by the entrepreneur for an art that 
        connected her to people, with bonding with the sea, forests and other elements of nature, as a therapy to combat 
        the stress of isolation.
      </p>
      <h4>Unique creations!</h4>
      <p>
        The creations are developed with a lot of love and seek to convey to the public respect for the millenary macrame
         technique. The artist conveys her inspirations in each piece, always with the aim of producing in her audience, 
         whether in their environment or in themselves, the positive feelings we feel when we are in contact with nature's creations. 
         The pieces are braided with extreme technical rigor in the production of high-quality pieces, without losing the rustic 
         character, typical of macramé.
      </p>
      <h4>We can tell you more about it!</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to studying and exploring macramé techniques, the artist seeks to know its origins. Where did a particular 
        weft come from? How was each type of knot created? What prompted the first artists to braid yarn? If you want to know a 
        little more about the origin of this art, you are welcome to visit our page 'About Macramé', which tells a little about 
        the history and meanings that macramé has in some cultures.

      <h3>About Macramé</h3>
      <h4>From ancient times…</h4>
      <p>
        Macramé is a very old technique, which uses only the hands to create unique pieces through the weaving of strings,
         cords or ropes. With this method, the craftsman creates knots, braids, fringes and geometric shapes with binding, 
         resulting in pieces with unique characteristics.
      </p>
      <h4>From shelter to art</h4>
      <p>
        The idea of braiding, tying and knotting fibers comes from prehistoric times, when our ancestors needed to create coverings 
        for protection and clothing with leaves and threads that were available in nature. From this origin, Macramé is believed to 
        have originated with 13th-century Arab weavers. These artisans knotted the excess thread and yarn along the edges of 
        hand-loomed fabrics into decorative fringes on bath towels, shawls, and veils. The Spanish word macramé is derived from the 
        Arabic migramah, believed to mean “striped towel”, “ornamental fringe” or “embroidered veil.” After the Moorish conquest, 
        the art was taken to Spain, then to Italy, especially in the region of Liguria, and then spread through Europe. It was 
        introduced into England at the court of Mary II in the late 17th century. Queen Mary taught the art of macramé to her 
        ladies-in-waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sailors made macramé objects in off hours while at sea, and sold or bartered them when they landed, thus spreading the art to 
        places like China and the New World. Nineteenth-century British and American sailors made hammocks, bell fringes, and belts 
        from macramé. They called the process “square knotting” after the knot they used most frequently. Sailors also called macramé 
        “McNamara's Lace”. [1]

      </p>
      <h4>Sustainability on the rise!</h4>
      <p>
        The technique became very popular again in the 70s, thanks to the hippie movement. Macramé pieces have gained new relevance
         in recent years, increasingly winning over the public that values handcrafted work, with a contemporary touch. One of
          the main reasons macramé is on the rise is because it is a sustainable, handmade technique that helps reduce
           the environmental impact of mass production.
      </p>
      <h4>Knots untangling the soul!</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to its artistic character and functionality, macramé has spiritual significance in some cultures. 
        In certain traditions, the technique is used as a tool of meditation and spiritual connection. Furthermore, the practice
         of macramé can also be used as a form of moving meditation. Repetitive knotting and focusing on the task can help 
         calm the mind.
