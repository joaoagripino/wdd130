      <h3>About Macramé</h3>
      <p>
        Macramé is a very old technique, which uses only the hands to create unique pieces through the weaving of strings,
         cords or ropes. With this method, the craftsman creates knots, braids, fringes and geometric shapes with binding, 
         resulting in pieces with unique characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of braiding, tying and knotting fibers comes from prehistoric times, 
        when our ancestors needed to create coverings for protection and clothing with leaves and threads 
        that were available in nature. This type of manual weaving was being improved and there are ancient 
        records about this technique in Turkey, China and Egypt, in addition to great prominence among the Arab peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technique became very popular in the 70s, thanks to the hippie movement. Macramé pieces have gained new relevance
         in recent years, increasingly winning over the public that values handcrafted work, with a contemporary touch. One of
          the main reasons macramé is on the rise is because it is a sustainable, handmade technique that helps reduce
           the environmental impact of mass production.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to its artistic character and functionality, macramé has spiritual significance in some cultures. 
        In certain traditions, the technique is used as a tool of meditation and spiritual connection. Furthermore, the practice
         of macramé can also be used as a form of moving meditation. Repetitive knotting and focusing on the task can help 
         calm the mind.
